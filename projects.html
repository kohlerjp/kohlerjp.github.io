             Aether is an iOS 8 application <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ther/id929890789?mt=8&uo=4" target="itunes_store">now available on the Apple Store.</a> It is a photo sharing application similar to SnapChat, except photos are shared randomly amongst friends. When a user sends an image out into the "Aether", they immediately receive a picture a friend has posted. I came up with the idea for Aether when trying to consider an application in which a user would need to produce content in order to consume content. Aether has a back-end written in Ruby on Rails, and a front-end written in Swift. Add me as a friend under <span class="username">KohlerExpress</span>.

              and 'bump' songs. I used Twitter bootstrap for the front end work. The blog is located at

              As part of the Entrepreneurs Club InnoWeekend, I worked together with a team to create an idea, a business plan, and a prototype, all in the span of 48 hours. We came up with the idea of join in, software that would gamify the college experience. Students would be awarded points for attending school events, which they could redeem for school merchandise. I was tasked with creating the prototype for the team. I built a website
              that allows users to create an account/profile, register for upcoming events, and see which events their friends are talking about/attending. The website is located
              <a href="http://guarded-beach-6975.herokuapp.com/">here.</a> Make a fake account and take a look around!

              For HackBeanpot 2014, a Boston based hack-a-thon, I worked together with a team to create a humble social network, one where users were not allowed to post about themselves. Users would log in through facebook, and choose a friend to talk about. After adding the functionality for posts to be anonymous, we decided to call it whisperer. We used the facebook open graph api, as well as a natural language processor, that would tint a post green if it was positive, or red if it was negative.

              For my first iPhone project, I wrote a simple app that allows users to play with gravity. Touch the screen and a planet will appear. Tap the screen again and another planet will appear, and the two will begin to orbit each other. More planets are added each time the screen is touched, which results in some visually pleasing orbiting patterns.
